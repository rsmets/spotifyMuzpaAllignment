To grab all of your Spotify followed artists:

    1) Go to https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-following/?type=artist&after=&limit=50
    2) scroll to bottom of page a click "Get Token", big green button.
    3) check mark "user-follow-read"
    4) click "Request Token", big green button
    5) copy the auth Token  
    6) in terminal type:
        python spotifyFollowedArtistGrabber.py THE_AUTH_TOKEN_YOU_JUST_COPIED
        whichi looks something like:
            python spotifyFollowedArtistGrabber.py BQAHYdRweompKPkKWjhT1JJ49Rc6vgomQ5tR0pirrQtyDUYV

Let finish and you now have all of your followed Spotify artist info in files artistNames.json & artistInfoPretty.json.

To then follow all of them in Muzpa:

    1) go to Muzpa website and login
    2) right click anywhere in the browser and click "Inspect" (if on Chrome)
    3) go to the "Network" tab
    4) click "XHR" (next to "All") in the tabs
    5) refresh the Muzpa webpage
    6) click on one of the captured network requests under "Name"
    7) in the right pane "General" under it containing "Request Url", for example, scroll down to "Request Headers"
    8) copy the value for "Cookie", most likely something like, SESS=6fb6428129bdd6927c87f31871270f6c715bc53
    9) in terminal type:
        python muzpaFollow.py artistNames.json COOKIE_VALUE_COPIED
        which will loke something like:
            python muzpaFollow.py artistNames.json SESS=6fb6428329bddc27c87f31871270f6c715bc53

Upon finishing you can see all the artist in artistName.json file followed on Muzpa. There will be some extra artist followed due to having to guess at the artistId in a few instances and some "Dj" or "feat" follows.
Just clean those up by hand. 

Enjoy!

I would recommend running this seasonally to keep Muzpa follow alligned with Spotify.
